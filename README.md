# Steam-Games-Hybrid-Game-Recommendation-System
This project is a Hybrid Game Recommendation System created by combining the concepts of Sentiment Analysis, Collaborative Filtering and Metadata based Content Filtering System.

This project is a combined work of Maahi Chatterjee, Ranjana Ajayakumar and Shivani Shivanand Suryawanshi as required for the fulfilment of the group project in our CmpE 256 : Large Scale Analytics course.

The repository includes the following:

SteamGamesHybridRecommendationSystem.ipynb : Notebook containing the implemntation of Sentiment Analysis, SVD and Metadata based Content Filtering merged together to create a hybrid recommendation system. This is the main project file and more information about each step can be found in the report. As an overview, the sequence of steps that were followed are : Data Cleaning , Sentiment Analysis, Content Based Filtering using metadata (Commented with recommendation function for only getting the similar items), SVD (Commented with the recommendation function for predicting only ratings using SVD) and the final hybrid recommendation function.
